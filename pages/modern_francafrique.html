            In 1945 the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) was Founded.
            Three years later the first French Uranium mine, Puy Henriette, was officially opened.

            13 times that of "normal" permissable exposure levels.

            at Mounana, Gabon from 1961 until the sites closure in 1999. This ore was milled
            and sent up through the Democratic Repubic of the Congo before boarding cargo ships
            for its shipment to France for enrichment and power production.

            After Niger was granted independence from France in 1960, Contracts were created to
            grant France the exclusive rights to mining and mineral exploitation in Niger. Excavation
            began near the Air Mountains in 1971 with two mines near the town of Arlit. Since mining
            has begun over 100,000 tons of uranium have been mined with France importing up to 50%
            of its uranium supply from Niger.

            France has maintained a military presence in Gabon and Niger to various extents since
            the 1960s. In more recent times France has used its military presence in Niger in the
            form of advisement to Niger's armed forces, as well as to protect its uranium investment
            in the country from terrorist threat.

            Data collected by the Observatory of Economic Complexity showed that, beginning in 1973,
            Nigers largest import to France has been uranium. 2017 was the last year this data was collected and it showed
            $289M USD export value for the year. Prior to 1973 green groundnuts were Niger's largest export to France.

            While the French multinational group Areva (now Orano) was overseeing uranium mining at the Arlit mines
            in Niger it was operating at a minimal tax which is questionable due toe the Extractive Industries Transparancy
            Initiative (EITI). It is also questionable how uranium accounts for 70% of Nigers exports but contributes
            only 5.8 percent to its GDP.

            France was Europe's largest exporter of electricity due in large part to its large volume of
            nuclear power generation. A large portion of the electricity exported was sent to the
            United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and Germany over this period of time.

            Reprocessing used nuclear fuel has been a policy in France for decades. This process allows for
            for still fissile material within the used fuel to be extracted and re-enriched so that it can enter
            the fuel chain once again. Issues with security, ecnvironmental and worker saftey, and cost
