            &emsp; France is the world's largest consumer of nuclear energy;
            deriving 75% of the country's electricty from its use. Since the beginnings
            of the French nuclear program in the 1950s, there has been
            an industry of importing uranium from the historically colonized countries
            of Gabon, Madagascar, and Niger. Of these three countries only
            Niger is operational and continues to supply France with Uranium ore for
            its nuclear reactors. The complex historical relationships, power dynamics, and colonial histories
            that exist between France and its African counterparts continues to
            exist in this intercontinental uranium chain.

            &emsp; Nuclear States of Being looks at this technopolitical entanglement
            through the use of landsat image bands; in this case bands 7, 6, and 11. Bands 7 and 6
            both cover different slices of the short wave infrared spectrum and are useful for distingushing
            wet and dry earth. Band 11 is a thermal infrared band that sees heat meaning it shows the temperature
            of the ground in the field of view. Combined, these bands give a false color rendering of the scene.<br><br>

            &emsp;The images show both the locations of uranium extraction and the
            locations of nuclear power distribution in France. Cities and towns where nuclear power is the
            source of electricity are shown in direct contrast with the possible locations where the ore
            that supplied their home with power was mined. Asking where the French
            "radiance" comes from and what dynamics were at play for that power to come to be are critical
            in developing this assemblage.

          <p>

            &emsp; The process of stiching together the different bands to create a new lens to view these
            drastically different environments in is meant to highlight the disconnect between the
            beauty of the images, the gaps within the supply chain, and the overall narrative at stake.<br><br>

          Uranium Red Book Valuation 2020 (WIP)

        <div class="section3-body">
          <p>
            &emsp; In 1965 the Nuclear Energy Agency,
            Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and the Atomic Energy Agency
            began publishing a biennial assessment of resources, supplies, production, and demand
            projections of uranium in order to try to establish a stable and recognized uranium market.
            This report has become known as the Red Book; it is a compilation of official data obtained
            through questionnaires and various government records. As anthropologist Gabrielle Hecht has
            shown, tools like the Uranium Red Book have been used to turn uranium into a banalized commodity.
            Through doing so, the tangible impact that the ore has on the places it is mined
            becomes flattened through the guise of development, production, and fiscal bottom lines.<br><br>

            &emsp; Organisations like the World Information Service on Energy (WISE) have spent years meticulously
            documented the health and environmental impacts of uranium mining and nuclear fuel production.
            Below are the covers of Red Books from the last 25 years with corresponding lists, collected by WISE, of
            events from the nuclear industry per correlated year. The events are not necessarily
            all negative or expository but they are meant to (un)sanitize the nature of the Red Book and offer a
            more complete view of the the uranium "market."

          <p>
            &emsp; The United States has generated 80,000 metric tons of high level nuclear
            waste since the beginning of its nuclear power industry. This waste is, in almost
            every circumstance, stored at the site of its generation; first stored in underground
            pools for up to seven years and then stored in above ground dry storage casks indefinitely.
            Potential sites of storage such as Yucca mountain are under relentless bi-partisan scrutiny
            and no consensus seems to be coming in the near future as to what a solution for the
            ever increasing storage issue
            could be. <br><br>
            &emsp; This design fiction questions the singular vision of nuclear waste as an unwanted byproduct
            of the nuclear fuel chain. More specifically the contextualization of the spent fuel as a material
            which is to be stored, hidden from the public for millenia, and never spoken of again
            as so many advocates and political pundits desire. However, Nuclear Waste Futures considers what
            a reframing of the above ground storage cask could look like as an apparatus for memorialization
            instead of disregard.
            &emsp;

          <p>
            &emsp; The cask form is ubiquitous with holding spent nuclear fuel that is radioactive
            for a timespan of over 100,000 years. Reimaginging it, instead, as an apparatus for
            memorialization reframes the legacies of each actor involved in the nuclear entanglement.
            This reframing allows for the histories of the people, communites, ecologies and so on
            to be placed at the forefront of infrastructural planning around the nuclear fuel chain. It
            also allows for the spent nuclear fuel to have its own agency and material-semiotic positioning
            within the nuclear world. <br><br>

          <p>
            &emsp; This fiction resides within a world of nuclear acceptance; the same form of respect, care, and maintenance
            is given to nuclear memorialization as with any other memorial or monument. Large plots
            of land are designated for the cask apparatuses to be gridded out and placed for onlookers
            to come pay their respects or wander around curiosly. Each memorialized cask is engraved with
            the specific latitudes and longitutes of locations where the movement of uranium, in whatever
            form it was in at the time, became entangled with other agents along its path towards its
            final mattering.<br><br>

          <p>
            In another situation the memorialized cask is put in context to replace iconic monuments.
            The question here is centered around asking what would happen if society thought of
            its energy supply, the outcome of that energy production and in terms as matters of care
            rather than as nuisances which have to be pushed under the metaphorical rug and literal mountain.
