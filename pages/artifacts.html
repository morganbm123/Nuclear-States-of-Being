            &emsp; France is the world's largest consumer of nuclear energy;
            deriving 75% of the country's electricty from its use. The country began
            an industry of importing uranium from the historically colonized countries
            of Gabon, Madagascar, and Niger starting in the late 1950s. Of the three only
            Niger continues to supply France with Uranium ore for its nuclear reactors. The
            complex historical relationships, power dynamics, and colonial histories
            that exist between France and its African counterparts continues to
            exist in this intercontinental uranium chain.<br><br>
            &emsp; Nuclear States of Being looks at this technopolitical entanglement
            through the lens of landsat images. These images show both the locations
            of uranium extraction and the locations of nuclear power generation. Cities
            and towns where nuclear power is the source of electricity are shown in
            direct comparison with the possible locations where the ore was mined.
            Changing frames and asking where the French "Radiance" comes from and
            what dynamics were in play for that power to come to be are ever important.
